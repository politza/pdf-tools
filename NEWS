* Version 0.70
** View
*** Register integration
    The keys m and ' now set resp. jump to a register corresponding to
    a position in the PDF. Also '' is handled special: It jumps to the
    position before the last register-jump.
*** Export parts of a page as an image
** Info
*** Interface changes
    The return value of many pdf-info-* functions was changed in order
    to prefer alists over other data-structures (indexed lists,
    trees).
** Virtual PDF
   A virtual PDF is a collection of pages (or parts thereof) of
   arbitrary documents, which appear to the rest of pdf-tools as one
   big PDF, though they are always read-only.
   
* Version 0.60
** Regexp support
   You may now search for perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE)
   in PDF documents, both via Isearch and Occur.  If that scares you,
   customize the variable pdf-occur-prefer-string-search.
** Occur
*** Asynchronous search
    Searching is performed asynchronously in a private server
    instance, i.e. it doesn't block neither ordinary editing nor
    pdf-view-mode.
*** Moccur
    Added the ability to search multiple documents in one occur
    buffer.
** Isearch
*** Occur Integration
    M-s o now starts occur, while keeping the isearch session, like it
    is in text-buffers.
*** Word search
    M-s w now does a word search, which will also find hyphenated
    words (as determined by pdf-isearch-hyphenation-character), though
    not at page boundaries.
** View
*** Navigate by pagelabels
    M-g l may be used to jump to a page by label, i.e. it's displayed
    number.
*** Rendering
    Added the ability to display the page as it would be printed
    (e.g. w/o annotations) and to apply a color filter
    (pdf-view-printer-minor-mode resp. pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode).
** Outline
   New option `pdf-outline-display-labels', determining whether to
   display labels instead of plain page-numbers.
* Version 0.50
** PDF Tools is now available on MELPA.
** SyncTeX
*** File name handling
   SyncTeX is pretty picky about source filenames.  So instead of
   trying various filenames and hoping for best, we find it by
   directly inspecting the database.
*** Heuristic backward search
    Backward searching now tries to find the exact position in the
    LaTeX buffer.  This may be disabled by setting
    pdf-sync-backward-use-heuristic to nil.
*** Renamed most variables/functions/commands.
    The old ones are still there but declared obsolete.
** Compatible with Emacs 24.3
** Integrate with bookmark.el
** Compiling on OSX
   PDF Tools should now compile on OSX, though it is unsupported.
** MELPA
   Try to handle an update via MELPA by package.el by shutting down
   the server, recompiling and restarting it.  This may be deactivated
   by setting pdf-tools-handle-upgrades to nil.
** Auto slicing
   A new minor mode which will automatically slice the page according
   to it's bounding box.
* Version 0.40
  I basically reimplemented the whole thing. (Not really, but a lot
  has changed.)
** Displaying PDF Files.
   Rendering is now done almost completely in libpoppler (no convert
   anymore), while PNG images are kept in memory and files are solely
   used as a means of exchange between Emacs and epdfinfo.  In
   essence, display should be much faster.
*** New Major Mode pdf-view
    Hacking up doc-view.el to support a server-based ,,rendering
    engine'' would have been to awkward. So a new major-mode was
    needed : pdf-view-mode . Both are very similar regarding
    user-interface.  Some differences are:
    + Setting the width to `fit-width', `fit-height' or `fit-page'
      keeps up with window-size changes.
    + The values of the slice are relative, i.e. independent of the
      image-size.
*** PNG Image Cache
    Image data is cached, in order to keep the time it needs to
    display a page low.  Some pages are pre-loaded for the same reason,
    while idling.  The number of cached images per buffer may be
    customized using `pdf-cache-image-limit'.
** Annotations
*** New supported types
    Provided epdfinfo was build with a recent version of libpoppler,
    you may now create and modify the following markup annotation
    types: highlight, squiggly, underline and strike-out.
** Various
*** You may now select extended regions with C-mouse-1.
*** Numerous other changes
